This assignment involves in implementing queues and gives you more than
average full credit. It deals with sequencing the playing cards after
shuffling and distributing the cards. One suit (one color) of cards is dealt
to shuffle in any way you like and districute the cards as specified in the
instructions. You are expected to write the code for reading the cards from
input file in to an array, shuffle the cards in a specific way and display the
cards in the desired sequence. You may use the concepts from the Reading
section about sequencing the playing cards. Display the shuffled queue. After
solving the problem for simpler (normal card sequence) queue, the same
concepts can be applied for a different sequence of cards as given in the
problem.

Provide the output after the cards from the input file, the sequence of cards
after shuffling (or placing) the cards and how you distribute (open) the cards
from the shuffled queue
